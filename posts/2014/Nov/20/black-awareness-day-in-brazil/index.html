<p>20 November is Black Awareness Day in Brazil. A day of celebration for the resistence of afro-Brazilians. Today, as always, Brazil white supremacy has strong voice in our education and litterature. Afro-brazilian great symbols are unknown to most Brazilians. Paradoxically, Brazil is the largest black country outside the African continent. A population of about 52% afro-Brazilians and very few, if not none of Brazil&#8217;s black heroes, are presented to our children. Black Awareness Day fights to break this strategy of making black people considered slave by&nbsp;nature.</p>
<p>This year black movement groups in Brazil are lauching a campaign to make Black Awareness day a national holiday in&nbsp;Brazil.</p>
<div class="section" id="who-is-zumbi">
<h2>Who is&nbsp;Zumbi?</h2>
<p>Zumbi is considered one of the greatest black heroes in the history of Brazil. But why Zumbi and not the others? Zumbi was the last leader of the Republic of Palmares, Palmares was the first independent republic in the Americas. In Palmares, africans, europeans and native americas lived in peace and liberty for almost a century. They were about 30000 people, a very large population by the time. At a time when most people in colonial Brazil were either illiterate Portuguese colonisers or enslaved&nbsp;africans.</p>
<p>Zumbi is today considered the symbol of Black Awareness Day in&nbsp;Brazil.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="palmares">
<h2>Palmares</h2>
<p>In early 1595, some of the enslaved Africans in Brazil broke the shackles of slavery and fled to the jungle between the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas. Initially it was a small band of escapees. But this group grew little by little untill it became a community of nearly thirty thousands &quot;rebel&quot; Africans. They established the first government of free Africans in the &quot;New World&quot;, insdiputably a true African State, known as the Republic of&nbsp;Palmares.</p>
<p>At more or less the same time it happened that, in Angola, the African Queen N’zingha was valiantly resisting, in armed struggle, the invasion of her territories by the&nbsp;Portuguese.</p>
<p>The republic of Palmares, with its immense population by the standards of the epoch, dominated a territorial area more or less one third the size of Portugal. This was the property of all. The fruits of collective labor were the property of all. The free Africans planted and harvested a wide variety of products and bartered with their white and indigenous Brazilian neighbours. They were very effectively both socially and politically, in their African manner and tradition, and were highly skilled in the art of&nbsp;war.</p>
<p>Palmares put into question the entire colonial structure: the army, the land tenure system of the Portuguese patriachs and the Catholic Church. it withstood some twenty-seven wars of destruction, wageg by both the Portuguese and the Dutch colonial military structures established in Pernambuco. Palmares resisted in armed struggle for almost one&nbsp;century.</p>
<p>These are only two historic examples out of the long history of resistance and struggle against foreign domination that is an integral part of our African heritage both in the continent and the&nbsp;Diaspora.</p>
<p>Zumbi, the last of Palmares is celebrated in the Pan-African experience of Brazil as the first hero of Pan-Africanism. We hope that he and his people of Palmares will be recognised and remembered by the rest of the Pan-African world as exemplary militants and forefathers of Pan-Africanism&nbsp;itself.</p>

<div class="section" id="national-holiday">
<h2>National&nbsp;holiday</h2>
<p>None of those black brazilians that fought for liberty and justice has a holiday in Brazil. Most of them are not even known to Brazilians, and most of those who&#8217;ve heard about them, doesn&#8217;t even know they were&nbsp;black.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-could-we-do-to-facilitate-black-awareness-in-brazil">
<h2>What could we do to facilitate black awareness in&nbsp;Brazil?</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First of all make sure that people recognize they live in a black&nbsp;country.</li>
<li>Never call the blacks a minority in&nbsp;Brazil.</li>
<li>Tell them about the glory and bravery of black people in the history of&nbsp;Brazil.</li>
<li>Make sure that people understand that Brazil was a country built by africans and not&nbsp;europeans.</li>
<li>Show them that almost every folklore, music, culinary, accents in Brazil was developed by the&nbsp;Africans.</li>
<li>Explain to them that they don&#8217;t see black people on <span class="caps">TV</span> because they are marginalized and&nbsp;inferiorized.</li>
<li>Study with them that in terms of politics, Brazil was in a dictature or in a democracy lead by either white supremacists or some members of the white dominating&nbsp;minority.</li>
<li>Fight to make Black Awareness Day a national holiday in&nbsp;Brazil.</li>
<li>Above all, help people being proud of being black and proud of being born in a country where their forefathers have&nbsp;built.</li>
</ul>
